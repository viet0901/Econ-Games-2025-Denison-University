## 🔍 Overview

This project explores the role of civic centers in driving economic growth and attracting new business tenants in Cincinnati’s Central Business District (CBD) and Over-the-Rhine (OTR). By combining parking and net sales data with qualitative interviews, we analyzed how foot traffic from civic spaces contributes to commercial success and proposed outreach strategies to help 3CDC attract businesses to both established and developing areas.

   * Forecasted food & beverage sector growth (2025–2026)

2. **Qualitative Interviews**

   * Conducted 8+ in-person interviews with business owners, employees, and law enforcement
   * Gathered first-hand insights on safety, community sentiment, and tenant decision-making

3. **Comparative District Analysis**

   * Compared civic event density and economic activity in Fountain Square vs. Washington Park
   * Evaluated OTR as an emerging commercial hotspot

4. **Strategic Communication Design**

   * Developed a dual-pronged strategy: direct outreach for established owners and digital marketing for young entrepreneurs
   * Proposed a 14-week educational program to support business onboarding

## ✨ Recommendations

* **Digital Marketing**: Use social media and video content to attract flexible, early-stage entrepreneurs outside Cincinnati.
* **North of Liberty Development**: Invest in the Finley Community Center near UC (45,000 students). Improve safety and offer rent control to incentivize entry.
* **14-Week Training Program**: Provide mentorship on leasing, funding, and business setup—especially valuable for new entrepreneurs.
* **Community Storytelling**: Showcase success stories from existing tenants to inspire incoming businesses.
